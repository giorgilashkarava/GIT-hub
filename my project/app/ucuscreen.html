<h1>Israel launches ground invasion in Lebanon with 'limited' raids on Hezbollah></h1>
<h2>The military said in a statement that it had begun "limited, localized, and targeted ground raids based on precise intelligence" against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon villages close to the border.</h2>

<p>This story has been updated with new information.

    Israel's troops entered Lebanon on Tuesday as part of what the Israeli military called a "limited, localized and targeted" ground operation aimed at dismantling Hezbollah command structures and weapons sites.
    
    The operation follows almost a year of near-daily Hezbollah missile attacks on northern Israel, which the Iran-backed group launched in the immediate aftermath of its ally Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel.
    
    Israel over the last year has been firing back on Hezbollah positions in Lebanon. Its ground invasion follows its detonation of booby-trapped pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members, two weeks of airstrikes in Lebanon that have killed more than 1,000 people, and its killing of Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah.
    
    'Tremendous blow to Hezbollah':Hezbollah leader Nasrallah dies in Israeli strike, upending region
    
    Israel says its latest assault is intended to make sure that about 60,000 displaced residents of Israel's northern areas can safety return to their homes. But it also represents an escalation of a long-simmering conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Iran-backed groups in the region.
    
    These groups − Hezbollah in Lebanon, Houthi rebels in Yemen and various militias in Iraq − have rallied behind Hamas after the latter killed 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages back to the Gaza Strip during its attacks on communities in southern Israel last year.
    
    It was not immediately clear what Israel meant by a "limited, localized and targeted" invasion. Israel says Hezbollah has a large network of tunnels and weapons storage facilities in southern Lebanon.
    
    Hezbollah was formed in 1982 with backing from Iran's newly formed Islamic Republic to pressure Tehran's arch-enemy Israel. It is sometimes described as a state within a state in Lebanon. Its heavily armed militia has political representation in Lebanon's parliament and enjoys support as a social movement in the country.
    
    However, Lebanon itself has historically stayed on the sidelines of a major conflicts with Israel. It did so in 2006 when Israel fought its last major war with Hezbollah, and again in 1982, when Israel invaded Lebanon and laid siege to Beirut to attack the Palestinian Liberation Organization, most of whose surviving members are now part of Fatah, a political group that maintains limited administrative control over parts of the West Bank, a Palestinian territory.

    Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Makati nevertheless said his country is facing "one of its most dangerous phases." He said about one million people have been displaced since Israel's assaults began last month. In Gaza, where Israel launched a massive assault on Hamas after its Oct. 7 attacks, most of the Palestinian enclave's 2.3 million people have been displaced. More than 41,300 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza health ministry.
    
    The White House and the U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Israel's ground operations in Lebanon, but on Monday, President Joe Biden called for a cease-fire.
    
    "I'm more worried than you might know and I'm comfortable with them stopping," Biden told reporters when asked if he was comfortable with Israeli plans for a cross-border incursion. "We should have a cease-fire now."
    
    Biden said the U.S. would send a "few thousand" more troops to the Middle East. The Pentagon said these troops would bolster security for the 40,000 U.S. troops already in the region and help with the defense of Israel.

    Israel last week rejected a proposal by the U.S. and France calling for a 21-day cease-fire on the Lebanon border to give time for a diplomatic settlement that would allow displaced civilians on both sides to return home.

    <h1>WATCH LIVE: Trump delivers campaign remarks on economy in Waunakee, Wisconsin</h1>
    <h2>trump new live wath does trump says?</h2>
    <img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.T114xdd9Fmw8Atl4ciuthQHaEK&pid=Api&P=0&h=220">
    <p>WAUNAKEE, Wis. (AP) — Former President Donald Trump plans to spend the hours ahead of Tuesday night’s vice-presidential debate campaigning in Wisconsin, stopping in a critical Democratic county that is crucial to Democrat Kamala Harris ‘ hopes for winning the key battleground state.

        The event is scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. EDT. Watch in the player above.
        
        Trump is scheduled to appear at a manufacturing facility in Waunakee, a suburb of Wisconsin’s capital city of Madison in the Democratic stronghold of Dane County. Trump has never campaigned in Dane County before and didn’t visit as president.
        
        Later on Tuesday, Trump is expected to hold an event at a museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin’s largest city and home to the largest number of Democratic voters and second-largest number of Republicans. His appearance there will also give him reach into the city’s conservative suburbs, a part of Wisconsin where his support has softened but where he must do well to win.
        
        Trump is expected to focus his comments on the economy. On Saturday, he held a rally in western Wisconsin where he blamed Harris for crimes committed by people in the country illegally.
        
        Both stops come ahead of Tuesday’s debate between Trump’s running mate JD Vance, a senator from Ohio, and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota.
        
        Dane County, the location of Trump’s first stop, is Wisconsin’s fastest-growing county and an economic engine for the state, fueled by jobs in the health care and tech industries. It is also home to the University of Wisconsin.
        
        Dane County’s population grew by about 30,000 people between 2016 and 2020. It has gone up by another 13,000 since then, based on the most recent U.S. Census Bureau estimate.
        
        That presents a challenge for Republicans, especially given that nearly 90% of registered voters in the county cast a ballot in 2020. President Joe Biden won 75% of the vote that year in Dane County, beating Trump by 181,000 votes in the county while carrying the state by fewer than 21,000. Hillary Clinton beat Trump in Dane County in 2016 by 47 points, and Trump won the state by less than a point.
        
        Still, Dane County is home to the third-largest number of Republican voters of any county statewide.
        
        “President Trump’s appearance will be a big shot in the arm for demoralized conservatives here,” the Dane County Republican Party Chairman Brandon Maly posted on X, the social media platform, when the visit was announced. He has said Trump must get at least 23% of the vote in Dane County to have a chance of winning statewide.
        
        Democratic presidential candidates have long come to Dane County to hold massive rallies to fire up the base. Harris campaigned there on Sept. 20, holding a rally in Madison that attracted more than 10,000 people.
        
        Waunakee, which bills itself as the “only Waunakee in the world,” is slightly more Republican than the county as a whole. In 2020, Trump got 36% of the vote there compared to less than 23% countywide.
        
        Trump is expected to speak at Dane Manufacturing, a metal fabricator that has a long history of hosting Republican candidates and officeholders. In Milwaukee, Trump will speak at Discovery World, a science and technology museum along the shores of Lake Michigan.</p>
        <h2>Russia proposes record defense spending as it pursues victory in Ukraine</h2>
        <img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2153497772.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_653,w_1160,c_fill/f_webp">
        <h3>The Kremlin wants to spend a record amount on defense next year</h3>
        <P>The Russian government wants to earmark 32.5% of its spending for defense in 2025, a record amount and up from a reported 28.3% this year, as Moscow seeks to prevail in the war in Ukraine.

            The government’s draft budget released Monday proposes spending just under 13.5 trillion rubles (over $145 billion) on national defense. That is about three trillion rubles ($32 billion) more than was set aside for defense in 2024, which was the previous record.
            
            The Ukraine war is Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II and has drained the resources of both sides, with Ukraine getting billions of dollars in help from its Western allies.
            
            Russia’s forces are bigger and better-equipped than Ukraine’s. In recent months the Russian army has gradually been pushing Ukrainian troops backward in eastern areas.
            
            Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the United States last week in pursuit of continuing financial and military support as the war approaches its three-year milestone next February.
            
            Russian President Vladimir Putin is also looking at how to sustain his war effort as military spending has placed a huge strain on the Russian economy.
            
            Earlier this month, Russia’s central bank raised its key interest rate by a full percentage point to 19% to combat high inflation. It held out the prospect of more rate increases to return inflation from the current 9.1% to the bank’s target of 4% in 2025.
            
            According to the draft budget, spending on defense should decline in 2026.
            
            The proposed budget could still change as it goes through three readings in the State Duma, Russia’s lower parliament house, and then goes to the Federation Council, the upper house, before the Russian president signs it into law.
            
            Meanwhile, on Monday Putin signed a call-up order for 133,000 conscripts in the autumn military draft, which is a routine number for seasonal conscription campaigns</P>

        <h2>why jude <br> bellingham stopped <br> scored?</h2>
        <h3>the midfielder is playing in a more <br> withdrawn role for los blancos this <br> season-but that isn't necessarily a bad <br> thing</h3>
        <img src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.WAp5CX5At2QuCt6qTwZKyQHaEK&pid=Api&P=0&h=220">
        <p>Midway through the second half of Real Madrid's derby clash with Atletico on Sunday, Jude Bellingham was up for a fight. Antonio Rudiger was scrapping with two opposing centre-backs from a Madrid corner, and when the big German went to the ground, Bellingham rushed to his defence.

            It's admittedly unclear what was said between Bellingham and Jose Gimenez - the language barrier might have had an impact there - but fighting words were clearly exchanged. A couple of half-shoves followed before cooler heads prevailed, but it was the testiness of it all that counted. This was a derby, one that had to be stopped due to fan violence, and in the middle of it all was a fired-up Bellingham.
            
            It all marks a new, updated version of the former Borussia Dortmund man. Last season, Bellingham was the new striker on the block, the pseudo-Karim Benzema replacement who was, at one point, a genuine contender to score 40 goals in all competitions for the best team in Europe.
            
            This campaign, however, the goals have dried up. Now, he's the left sided No.8 he was perhaps always supposed to be; the all-round, all-action, box-to-box player who can do a bit of everything. The goals might have dried up, but Bellingham is still as effective as ever - just in a different way.</p>

            <h4>Harry Kane was substituted in Bayern Munich's 1-1 draw with Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday</h4>
            <h3>Striker Harry Kane will be assessed before Bayern Munich's Champions <br> League game at Aston Villa on Wednesday.</h3>
            <p>The England captain came off in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Bayer Leverkusen with an ankle problem. <br>

                He has trained and travelled with the squad for the match at Villa Park, and a decision will be made on the day. <br>
                
                "I think you have seen Harry was on the pitch today, that went well but we will still have to wait until tomorrow and see how the situation is and then we will make the correct decision," said Bayern boss Vincent Kompany. <br>
                
                "He trained with us today and hopefully everything will work out fine." <br>
                
                Kane has 10 goals in seven appearances this season, while on Thursday interim England manager Lee Carsley names his squad for the Nations League games against Greece and Finland.</p>
